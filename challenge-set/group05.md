# CSE 280 Challenge Set 05

(c) BYU-Idaho

## Question 1

For each relation below, determine which property they satisfy.  Each relation has the domain of $\mathbf{R}$.  Remember to use a digraph if you need help.

|Relation|Reflexive, Anti-Reflexive or Neither|Symmetric, Anti-Symmetric or Neither|Transitive|Equivalence|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|$_aR_b, \text{ if } a^2 = b^2$|||||
|$_aR_b, \text{ if }\lfloor a \rfloor = b$|||||
|$_aR_b, \text{ if } a-b \ge 0$|||||
|$_aR_b, \text{ if } -a-b = 1$|||||
|$_aR_b, \text{ if } a-b = 5$|||||

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

## Question 2

Determine if each of the following relations are equivalences and why.  The domain for these relations is $\lbrace A, B, C, D \rbrace$? 

* $\lbrace (A,B), (B,A), (C,D), (D,C) \rbrace$

<br /><br />

* $\lbrace (A,A), (B,B), (C,C), (D,D), (A,B), (B,A), (C,D), (D,C) \rbrace$

<br /><br />

* $\lbrace (A,B), (B,C), (C,B), (B,A), (A,A), (B,B), (C,C), (D,D) \rbrace$

<br /><br />

* $\lbrace (A,A), (B,B), (C,C), (D,D), (A,B), (B,C), (A,D), (A,C), (D,C) \rbrace$

<br />

## Question 3

For the following parts, assume that the domain of each relation is $\lbrace A, B, C \rbrace$.  There may be more than one correct answer for each part.

### Part 1

Draw a digraph of a relation that satisfies only the reflexive property.

<br /><br />

### Part 2

Draw a digraph of a relation that satisfies only the symmetric property.

<br /><br />

### Part 3

Draw a digraph of a relation that is an equivalence.

<br /><br />

### Part 4

Draw a digraph of a relation that satisifies both reflexive and transitive properties only.

<br /><br />

### Part 5

Draw a digraph of a relation that is both an equivalance and anti-symmetric (this is not a trick question ... it is possible).

<br /><br />

## Question 4

### Part 1

Define the relationship $_aR_b$ if $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by 5.  The domain of $a$ and $b$ is $\mathbf{Z}$.  Identify all of the equivalence classes and their contents. 

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

### Part 2

Identify the equivalence classes for all of the equivalence relations from Question 1 above.
